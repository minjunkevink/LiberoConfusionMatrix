TODO:
- pipeline random sampling for libero90 demonstrations
- check r3m official doc and `extract` for lang embedding (learnable?)
- figure out trajectory division for subtasks on long horizon (continuous)
- check if Bridgev2 has annotated subtasks

  **Bridgev2 Notes**
  - 9,731 rollouts from a scripted pick-and-place policy: perhaps not enough language diversity
  - about 85% of them are teleoperated (demonstrated): we want few demonstrations...? -> ask Jesse
